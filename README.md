## Initial Setup
Before deploying the application via GitHub Actions, users must complete an initial setup that includes configuring GitHub secrets and variables. This setup ensures secure access to AWS resources and proper configuration of the deployment environment. 

### AWS S3 bucket for state files
To ensure a clean deployment and teardown of the project infrastructure, it is essential to store Terraform state files in an S3 bucket during the deployment (terraform apply) stage. Without storing the state files, any infrastructure provisioned during deployment cannot be properly destroyed using the GitHub Actions Terraform destroy workflow.

To create an empty S3 bucket for this purpose, follow these steps:
* Log in to the AWS Management Console.
* Navigate to the S3 service dashboard.
* Click the Create bucket button.
* Enter a unique name for the bucket.
* Click Create bucket to finalize creation.
* Record the bucket name, as it will be required when setting up GitHub Variables.

### GitHub Secrets
For successful deployment, the following GitHub secrets must be created:

| Secret Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` | The access key for your AWS IAM user with appropriate deployment permissions |
| `AWS_SECRET_KEY` | The secret access key paired with your AWS access key ID |
| `EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY` | The API key used for embedding service authentication (provided to the user) |

To create each secret follow the steps listed below : 
1. Navigate to the project's GitHub repository
2. Click on `Settings` → `Secrets and variables` → `Actions`
3. Select `New repository secret`
4. Enter the secret name and value
5. Click `Add secret`

***NOTE:*** The embeddings API key will be proided to the user

### GitHub Variables
For successful deployment, the following GitHub variables must be created:

| Variable Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `AWS_REGION` | The AWS region where your resources will be deployed (e.g., `us-east-1`) |
| `TF_STATE_BUCKET` | The S3 bucket name for storing Terraform state files. User must have this bucket already created in their AWS backend |

To create each variable follow the steps listed below : 
1. Navigate to the project's GitHub repository
2. Click on `Settings` → `Secrets and variables` → `Actions`
3. Select the `Variables` tab
4. Click `New repository variable`
5. Enter the variable name and value
6. Click `Add variable`

***NOTE:*** For `TF_STATE_BUCKET` make sure to use the same name given to the S3 bucket created in step 1 (AWS S3 bucket for state files)

## Deployment via GitHub Actions & Terraform

### Workflow Overview
This project repository includes a **single reusable workflow** (`Deploy Uni-Com`)  which can be triggered manually through GitHub Actions. The workflow description is provided in `.github/workflows/main.yml`. 

Deploy Uni-Com contains 2 job descriptions :
* **Terraform_apply** – provisions all AWS resources, builds the frontend and deploys the application.
* **Terraform_destroy** – tears down the provisioned infrastructure.

### Setup Action
Before running Actions workflow, ensure all GitHub secrets and variables are properly configured. To deploy the application, follow the steps listed below :
1. On the Github repository page, navigate to **Actions → Deploy Uni-Com → Run workflow**.
2. Choose **Terraform_apply** from the drop-down.
3. Click on `Run Workflow`
4. Navigate to the `All workflows` tab, where a new workflow run will be running. Click on it.
5. Click on `Terraform Apply`
6. Upon a successful apply the Cognito login URL, logout URL, Cloudfront distribution domain and API Gateway URL will be displayed.


### Teardown Action
To destroy all provisioned infrastructure, follow the steps listed below
1. Go to **Actions → Deploy Uni-Com → Run workflow** again.
2. Select **Terraform_destroy** from the dropdown.
3. Click on `Run Workflow`
4. Navigate to the `All workflows` tab, where a new workflow run will be running.
5. Upon successful completion, the provisioned AWS infrastructure will be destroyed.

## Using the Application

We've created a short demonstration video on how to use the application which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-51bH-6eQ8om26i9CdR_mHPr4g4JBCPb/view?usp=sharing).

### Note: The homepage URL is same as the CloudFront URL which is displayed in the terraform output as `cloudfront_distribution_domain_name`.
